## medLLM_QA_benchmark
Trilingual medical QA benchmark for English, Japanese, and Chinese.

This repository is made to evaluate [ELAINE-medLLM](https://huggingface.co/kenyano/Llama3-ELAINE-medLLM-8B), [ELAINE-medLLM-instruct](https://huggingface.co/kenyano/Llama3-ELAINE-medLLM-instruct-8B), a lightweight English-Japanese-Chinese trilingual large language model for the Biomedical Domain.
It contains a wide range of medical QA benchmarks for three languages and provides scripts and Python source files for evaluating LLM.
The evaluation method uses a consistent language-dependent input format to evaluate medical LLM on all benchmarks.
Any LLM models supported by [vllm](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) can be evaluated.
We have checked those models on the hugging face hub, but a locally stored checkpoint can also be used for evaluation.

### This benchmark set is made using the following dataset.

Please abide by the original license for each benchmark.
MedQA(MIT),MMLU(MIT),MedMCQA(MIT),PubMedQA (MIT), CMExam(Apach-2.0), JJISMQA(cc-by-nc-sa-4.00).

If the original QA benchmark contains splits for training, validation, and testing, we used only the testing split.

### How to evaluate the medical LLMs using this benchmark

### <ins>Interactive evaluation</ins>

#### Test a single benchmark with a model
```
Usage: sh scripts/experiment.sh json_test_file model_name_or_path output_dir language few_shots
	json_test_file:		file path to the input JSON file
	model_name_or_path:	model name or path
	output_dir:	root dir for results
	lang:	the language of the benchmark
	few_shots:	number of shots for in-context learning
``` 

#### Evaluate a single result with a gold answer
```
Usage: sh scripts/evaluate.sh pred_file answer_file
	pred_file:	file path to the JSON file generated under the output_dir
	answer_file:	file path to the input JSON file used for evaluation 
```

### <ins>Batch mode evaluation</ins>

#### Test all benchmarks with multiple LLM models

To change the LLM models to be used for the experiment, manually edit the script
**scripts/experiment_batch.sh**

The following snippet shows how to add the LLM model named 'xxxx/yyyy' to experiments.
If you'd like to remove a LLM model from evaluation, comment out the model declaration.

```
hf_model_path=xxxx/yyyyy
model_path+=($hf_model_path)
```

The following script runs an experiment for all models for each one of the benchmark datasets.

```
Usage: sh scripts/experiment_batch.sh output_dir few_shots
	output_dir:	root dir for results
	few_shots:	number of shots for in-context learning
```
#### Evaluate all results with gold answers
```
Usage: sh scripts/evaluate_batch.sh output_dir
	output_dir:	root dir for results
```

### Convert the evaluation result log to a CSV file
Using the following script, you can convert the evaluation log to a compact CSV file.
```
sh scripts/evaluate_batch.sh output_dir > log
cat log | grep @@ > results.csv
```
